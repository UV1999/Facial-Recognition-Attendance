# Facial-Recognition-Attendance
There are lots of problems faced with the current technique used in the attendance system all over the world. It is a time-consuming process and there are more chances for a possible mishap during the manual attendance taking system. All the disadvantages of the manual method of attendance system can be totally eliminated with the help of an automated facial recognition attendance system. This system has seen many improvements over all these years. Facial Recognition Attendance is an attendance system that can be used to take attendance anywhere. This Facial Recognition Attendance uses technologies like Python Tkinter GUI, Python 3, OpenFace, and OpenCV. The system detects the face in the camera and then check it with the data saved about the particular person in the database. After comparing both the face in the camera and the database if there is a match, then the data will be stored in an excel file with the current time indicating that the person is present on the same day. Finally, at the end of the day, the main objective of the project is to make the attendance process much easier and to conserve the precious time which otherwise would be lost.
